# MY-DATA-SCIENCE-JOURNEY
📊 My Data Science Journey — A public record of my growth as a data science learner. This repo includes notes, Python practice, SQL work, data analysis, visualizations, and machine learning projects built while completing the IBM Data Science Professional Certificate and developing real-world skills.
# 👋 Who I Am

I’m currently learning data science step by step and building my skills in public. This repo is my personal space where I track my progress, practice coding, and grow towards becoming a strong data scientist.

# 📚 What I’m Learning

Right now I’m working through the IBM Data Science Professional Certificate and focusing on Python, SQL, data analysis, visualization, and machine learning. My goal is to learn by doing real practice instead of just watching videos.

# 🚀 Projects List

• Python learning notebooks
• Data analysis practice
• SQL exercises
• Visualization experiments
• Machine learning practice (coming soon)
• Capstone project (upcoming)
## 📅 GitHub Day 2

Day 2 of my data science journey. Continued learning through the IBM Data Science course and practicing basic concepts. Focused on understanding core ideas, exploring tools, and staying consistent with daily progress. Small steps every day toward becoming a better data scientist 🚀.
